## What You'll Be Doing

A web server is a special type of computer that is configured specifically to serve web pages. Over 90% of the world's web servers run on Linux operating systems. The main difference between a commercial server and a Pi server is the speed at which the pages will be served.

## Let's Get Started

Make sure that you've [installed LAMP](mdwiki.html#!01lamp.md) then you'll be ready to host your own [web site](mdwiki.html#!01website.md)
