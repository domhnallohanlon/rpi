### Goal

By the end of this chapter you should have a fully functioning web server running on your Raspberry Pi. 


### Setting Up Your Web Server: An Overview
Downloading and configuring a web server on your Raspberry Pi is relatively straightforward. Detailed walkthroughs of the steps required are included below.

### What You'll Be Doing

A web server is a special type of computer that is configured specifically to serve web pages. Over 90% of the world's web servers run on Linux operating systems. The main difference between a commercial server and a Pi server is the speed at which the pages will be served.
