### Creating a Website

Now that we have a functioning web server, we can create and serve dynamic content to our viewers. Information that is stored in our database, such as usernames and passwords, can be accessed and used to deliver customised content to the visitor. In order to do this we'll first take a look and the HTML and CSS languages that are used to generate static sites and then introduce some PHP that can be used to generate server-side pages.

### HTML

**H**yper**t**ext **M**arkup **L**angague, or HTML, is the native language of the web. It was originally designed so that scientists could quickly and easliy generate and diseminate content to their network. 
HTML is a simple and flexible language that uses _tags_ to _markup_, or give meaning to, content. An HTML tag can be recognised by the brackets `< >` that surround it. Tags typically occur in pairs - corresponding opening and closing tags - but we will see some examples of self-closing tags too.

Here's a very simple HTML page:

```HTML
<html>
    <head>
        <title>My Web Page</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Hello World!</h1>


    </body>
</html>
```
