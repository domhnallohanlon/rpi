### Goal

By the end of this chapter you should have a Raspberry Pi with fully functioning operating system and it should capable of running "headless" i.e. without a keyboard, mouse or monitor.

### Setting Up Your Raspberry Pi: An Overview

To make your life a little easier (and load times a little quicker) this chapter is broken into five sections: 
<ol>
    <li> [Installing Raspbian ](http://domhnallohanlon.github.io/rpi/00raspbian.html) [ [.pdf]](http://domhnallohanlon.github.io/rpi/00raspbian.pdf)</li>
    <li> [Installing TightVNC Server](00tightvncserver.html)</li>
    <li> [Installing PuTTY or similar](00putty.html)</li>
    <li> [Installing a VNC Client](00vncclient.html)</li>
    <li> [Basic Terminal Commands](00terminal.html)</li>
</ol>

The links above give a detailed walkthrough of how to accomplish each step, or alternatively you can download the instructions as a PDF file for offline reading. The sections below give just a brief overview of the steps as well as introducing some of the Raspberry Pi and Linux terminology.
    
### What You'll Be Doing

In a nutshell, to get through each workshop you'll have to be comfortable installing applications and executing commands from the terminal. If you're comfortable with all of this already you can probably procede to [Chapter 1](http://domhnallohanlon.github.io/rpi/01overview.html)
