## Goal

By the end of this chapter you should have a Raspberry Pi with fully functioning operating system and it should capable of running "headless" i.e. without a keyboard, mouse or monitor.

## Setting Up Your Raspberry Pi: An Overview

To make your life a little easier (and load times a little quicker) this chapter is broken into five sections: 
<ol>
<li> [Installing Raspbian ](mdwiki.html#!00raspbian.md) 
    [[.pdf]](http://domhnallohanlon.github.io/rpi/00raspbian.pdf)
</li>
<li>[Installing TightVNC Server](mdwiki.html#!00tightvncserver.md)
    [[.pdf]](http://domhnallohanlon.github.io/rpi/00tightvncserver.pdf)
</li>
<li>[Installing PuTTY](mdwiki.html#!00putty.md)
    [[.pdf]](http://domhnallohanlon.github.io/rpi/00putty.pdf)
</li>
<li> [Installing a VNC Client](mdwiki.html#!00vncclient.md)
    [[.pdf]](http://domhnallohanlon.github.io/rpi/00vncclient.pdf)
</li>
<li> [Basic Terminal Commands](mdwiki.html#!00terminal.md)
    [[.pdf]](http://domhnallohanlon.github.io/rpi/00terminal.pdf)
    </li>
</ol>

The links above give a detailed walkthrough of how to accomplish each step, or alternatively you can download the instructions as a PDF file for offline reading. The sections below give just a brief overview of the steps as well as introducing some of the Raspberry Pi and Linux terminology.
    
## What You'll Be Doing

In a nutshell, to get through each workshop you'll have to be comfortable installing applications and executing commands from the terminal. If you're comfortable with all of this already you can probably procede to [Chapter 1](http://domhnallohanlon.github.io/rpi/01overview.html)

## About the Raspberry Pi

The Raspberry Pi is (probably!) the best selling single-board computer in the world. In just 3 years (Feb 2012 to Feb 2015) the Raspberry Pi foundation licensed <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/five-million-sold/" target="_blank">5 million</a> boards. 
The first two models of the Raspberry Pi were the imaginatively named A and B, although in recent years the family has expanded to include the A+, B+, Pi 2 B+ and Compute boards too.

A number of design improvements were implemented with the next major version, the B+. This was not released and a new "version" since the underlying processor, RAM etc was the same. On the B+ the connectors are accessibe from just two sides, rather than three as was previously the case. The connectors themselves no longer overhang the board to the same extent and B+ is less power hungry than its ancestor, consuming 3W compared to 3.5W for the model B.
